# School Exam 2022 - Agile Library (1/3)

## Advice
This is not meant to be used as a cheat, it is meant to show part of my progress, for this reason i did not announce the name of the school and neither the exam. I hope this will only be used as a reference of my coding ability as an student.

## Requirements 
This exercise require an developer to: 
* Show 3 books ( title, author, year, status and borrower | Thhose first three are provided by the school );
* Borrow a book;
* Return a book;
* Register a new book;

## Extra
If possible, make so that the information is persistent ( as in an data base ).
