# School Exam 2022 - Agile Library (1/3)

## Advice
This is not meant to be used as a cheat, it is meant to show part of my progress, for this reason i did not announce the name of the school and neither the exam. I hope this will only be used as a reference of my coding ability as an student.

## Requirements 
This exercise require an developer to: 
* Show 3 books ( title, author, year, status and borrower | Thhose first three are provided by the school );
* Borrow a book;
* Return a book;
* Register a new book;

## Extra
If possible, make so that the information is persistent ( as in an data base ).

## Links

I used 'target="_blank"' but it did not work, so you must manually open the links below in a new tab.

### Important : Promises may take a while and you may need to refresh the data manually, it worked fine on localhost, but on free heroku it gets very slow, so, i decided to let the timeout time in 1000ms, and let the user refresh data by clicking "pesquisar". If you which to see it run fast, download the repository, enter "json" folder and use `npm start` command to start the localhost, take the adress and use it on `_url` variable at "biblioteca-api.js" ("front" folder).
